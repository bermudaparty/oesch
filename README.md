## Stata module to recode ISCO codes into Oesch class scheme
This module provides two commands to recode 4 digit ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 (International Classification of Occupations) codes into the class scheme proposed by Oesch. They are adaptations of the scripts provided by Daniel Oesch at http://people.unil.ch/danieloesch/scripts/. The module follows the same logic as the isko and isco Stata modules by John Hendrickx. And additional command is provided to recode 16-class versions into the lower available versions.

## How to install
- By executing `ssc install oesch` in Stata
- By using the https://github.com/haghish/github module
